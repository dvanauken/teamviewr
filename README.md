# Dockerized Spring Boot Application

This Spring Boot application utilizes Java 17 and integrates seamlessly with a PostgreSQL database via Spring Data JPA. It exposes REST APIs for efficient management of products, orders, and order items. The application is containerized using Docker, and its robustness is ensured through comprehensive testing with JUnit and Mockito.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Gradle (for building the application)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dvanauken/teamviewr
    cd teamviewr
    ```
## Setting up the Database

2. **To build the database, run the `setup_db.bat` script located in the `database` directory. This script references `ddl.sql` for creating the schema and `dml.sql` for populating the tables.**

   ```bash
   cd database
   setup_db.bat

3. **Build the Application**

   Use Gradle to build the project:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```


4. **Build the Application Excluding Tests with Stack Trace**

   For a build excluding tests and providing a stack trace in case of errors, use:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean build -x test --stacktrace
    ```

   This command ensures a clean build by first cleaning any existing build artifacts, then building the project excluding tests. The `--stacktrace` option provides a detailed stack trace in case of build errors. It generates an executable JAR file in the `build/libs` directory.

## Running the Application with Docker

1. **Docker and Docker Compose Setup**

   Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. The application along with the PostgreSQL database can be orchestrated using Docker Compose.


2. **Start the Application**

   Navigate to the project root directory and execute:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## Accessing the Application

- **API Endpoints**: Upon successful deployment, the REST API endpoints can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/api/`.

- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Detailed API documentation generated by OpenAPI can be found at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.



## Testing the Application

- **Executing Tests**

  Execute automated tests using Gradle:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew test
    ```

  This command runs all unit and integration tests within the project.

## Troubleshooting

- In case of encountering issues with Docker or Docker Compose, ensure you have the latest versions installed and refer to the Docker documentation for resolutions.
- For application-specific issues, analyzing the application logs can offer valuable insights into the problem.
